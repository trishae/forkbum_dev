This post details what I did to fix those issues to deploy my wesite via Github Pages. The following information is only applicable to MacOS and Linux users. (Review the first blocker <a href=\"https://forkbum.com/blog/002\">here</a>.)</p>\n<h5>> the problem</h5>\n<p>On July 30, 2020, GitHub Security published <a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-07-30-token-authentication-requirements-for-api-and-git-operations/\">this article</a> announcing that GitHub will no longer be using passwords when authenticating with REST APIs on GitHub.com and developers can begin using token-based authentication on November 2020. A December 15, 2020 <a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/\">article</a> was subsequently published providing more information, including the announcement that passwords will no longer be accepted when authenticating on August 13, 2021 and after.</p>\n<p>August 13 was pretty recent to the date I deployed/published my site, and I had not known about it, so it caused me some confusion.</p>\n<p>Basically, I kept receiving this error when attempting to push my build to the gh-pages branch (to publish my website):</p>\n<pre><code>remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.\n\nremote: Please see https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information.\n\nfatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/myUsername/myRepo.git/'\n</code></pre>\n<h5>> the solution</h5>\n<p>In hindsight, this isn't as much of a catastrophic issue as the previous build issue, but I figured this walkthrough could be helpful for some.</p>\n<p><em>Note: if your repositories use SSH, you can authenticate via SSH keys.</em></p>\n<p>Alright - first, follow these steps to create a personal access token.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign in to github.com, and navigate to <em>Settings</em> under your account drop-down menu.</li>\n<li>Click <em>Developer settings</em>.</li>\n<li>Click <em>Personal access tokens</em>.</li>\n<li>Click <em>Generate new token</em>.</li>\n<li>Enter a descriptive name for the token, and set its time to expire.</li>\n<li>Select the permissions to grant for this token.</li>\n<li>When finished with setting token attributes (steps 5 and 6), click <em>Generate token</em>.</li>\n<li>You should be able to see your generated token, which should look like: \"ghp_[random alphanumeric characters]\". You can either cache it or store it in a textfile. (Lol make sure not to store it in file in your project filesystem.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After token generation, you will need to open your terminal and enter these commands:</p>\n<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name \"githubUsername\"\n\n$ git config --global user.email \"githubEmailAddress\"\n\n$ git remote set-url origin https://&#x3C;tokenStream>@github.com/&#x3C;githubUsername>/&#x3C;reponame>.git\n</code></pre>\n<p>After these changes, you should be able to push to the publishing branch!</p>"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
